## Elixir training


The purpose is to learn Elixir, baby steps, seeking to understand the syntax
so that you can work with a broad knowledge of the language before trying to 
go to your framework, Phoenix, well, that's probably why I should write articles
about my journey and indicate some repositories that I will use for some projects
and thanks for your attention =]
